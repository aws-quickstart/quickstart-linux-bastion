This Quick Start also assumes familiarity with the following AWS Services.

* http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/vpc/[Amazon VPC] – The Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) service lets you
provision a private, isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS
services and other resources in a virtual network that you define. You have complete
control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of an IP address
range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways.

* http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ec2/[Amazon EC2] – The Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) service enables you
to launch virtual machine instances with a variety of operating systems. You can choose
from existing Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) or import your own virtual machine
images.

* http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEBS.html[Amazon EBS] – Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides persistent block-level storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud. Each
Amazon EBS volume is automatically replicated within its Availability Zone to protect
you from component failure, offering high availability and durability. Amazon EBS
volumes provide consistent and low-latency performance to run your workloads.

* http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-nat-gateway.html[NAT Gateway] – NAT gateways are network address translation (NAT) devices, which
provide outbound Internet access to instances in a private subnets, but prevent the
Internet from accessing those instances. NAT gateways provide better availability and
bandwidth than NAT instances. The NAT Gateway service is a managed service that
administers NAT gateways for you. 

* http://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/latest/userguide/[Auto Scaling]– Auto Scaling helps you ensure that you have the desired number of EC2
instances available to handle the load for your application. You create collections of EC2
instances, called Auto Scaling groups. When you deploy the Quick Start, you can specify
the desired number of instances in each Auto Scaling group, and Auto Scaling ensures
that your group has this number of instances at all times.

* http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/[Amazon CloudWatch Logs] – You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store,
and access your log files from EC2 instances, AWS CloudTrail, and other sources. You
can retrieve the log data from CloudWatch Logs, and monitor your EC2 instances in near-real
time.
