This Quick Start provides Linux bastion host functionality for AWS Cloud infrastructures. It
deploys a virtual private cloud (VPC) using the https://fwd.aws/9VdxN[Amazon VPC Quick Start reference
deployment]. Then, it sets up private and public subnets and deploys Linux bastion instances into
the VPC. You can also choose to deploy Linux bastion hosts into your existing AWS
infrastructure.

The bastion hosts provide secure access to Linux instances located in the private and public
subnets. The Quick Start architecture deploys Linux bastion host instances into every public
subnet to provide readily available administrative access to the environment. The Quick
Start sets up a Multi-AZ environment consisting of two Availability Zones. If highly
available bastion access is not necessary, you can stop the instance in the second
Availability Zone and start it up when needed.

You can use this Quick Start as a building block for your own Linux-based deployments.
You can add other infrastructure components and software layers to complete your Linux
environment in the AWS Cloud. To build an AWS Cloud infrastructure for accessing
Microsoft Windows-based instances, see the https://fwd.aws/5VrKP[Quick Start for Remote Desktop (RD)
Gateway].
