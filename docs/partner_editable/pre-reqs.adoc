NOTE: Consider choosing a region closest to your data center or corporate network to

on your corporate network.

* Create a http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[key pair] in your preferred region. To do this, in the navigation pane of the

Amazon EC2 uses public-key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt login information. To
be able to log in to your instances, you must create a key pair. On Linux, the key pair is
used to authenticate SSH login.
