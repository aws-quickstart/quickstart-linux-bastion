This Quick Start deployment guide provides instructions for deploying Linux bastion hosts
in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) environment on the Amazon Web
Services (AWS) Cloud. The Quick Start also provides http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/[AWS CloudFormation^] templates that
automate the deployment.

The guide is for IT infrastructure architects, DevOps engineers, and administrators who want to deploy Linux bastion hosts to manage their AWS Cloud deployments remotely.

http://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/[Quick Starts^] are automated reference deployments for AWS Cloud infrastructure
components and key enterprise workloads on the AWS Cloud. Each Quick Start launches,
configures, and runs AWS compute, network, storage, and other services, using AWS best
practices for security and availability.
