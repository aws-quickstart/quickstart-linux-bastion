Deploying this Quick Start for a new virtual private cloud (VPC) with
default parameters builds the following {partner-product-short-name} environment in the
AWS Cloud.

.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture,width=100%,height=100%]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* An internet gateway to allow access to the internet. This gateway is used by the bastion
hosts to send and receive traffic.*
* Managed NAT gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private
subnets.*
* A Linux bastion host in each public subnet with an Elastic IP address. These allow inbound
SSH (Secure Shell) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.
* A security group for fine-grained inbound access control.
* An Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group with a configurable number of instances.
* A set of Elastic IP addresses that match the number of bastion host instances. If the
Auto Scaling group relaunches any instances, these addresses are reassociated with the
new instances.
* An Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group to hold the Linux bastion host shell history logs.
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.

[.small]#*The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
