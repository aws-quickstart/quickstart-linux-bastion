== Postdeployment steps

=== Confirm that you can log in to the bastion host

Log in to the bastion host.
Use one of the following user names, depending on your choice of Linux distribution:

* Amazon Linux / SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES): *ec2-user*
* CentOS: *centos*
* Ubuntu: *ubuntu*

The Linux distribution is specified in the *Bastion AMI operating system* parameter when you deploy the templates.

== Additional information

=== Bastion logging

The bastion hosts deployed by this Quick Start provide a command logger in the
`/var/log/audit/audit.log` file.
This log file contains the date, SSH client connection IP address, user name, working directory, and the commands issued.

For added security, the contents of the `/var/log/audit/audit.log` file is also stored in a CloudWatch Logs log group in the AWS Cloud and remains available in case the bastion hosts fail.

The log includes a history of the commands that are run when you log in. <<logging>> shows an example.

The `bastion.log` file is an immutable file that cannot be easily deleted or tampered with.
However, in case this happens, there is a shadow file with a copy of `bastion.log` located in `/var/log/audit/audit.log`.
The Quick Start also stores the contents of `bastion.log` remotely using the CloudWatch Logs service.
Log files can be found under CloudWatch Logs using the instance ID as the log stream name.

=== Remote access

This Quick Start provisions one Linux bastion host in each Availability Zone with a single security group as a virtual firewall.
This security group is required for remote access from the Internet if a remote access CIDR block was configured for the deployment.
The security group is configured as follows:

==== Inbound

|===
|Source|Protocol|Ports

|Remote access CIDR|TCP|22
|Remote access CIDR|ICMP|N/A
|===

==== Outbound

|===
|Destination|Protocol|Ports

|0.0.0.0/0 |All|All
|===
