== Postdeployment steps
=== Confirm that you can log in to the bastion host

Log in to the bastion host.
Use one of the following user names, depending on your choice of Linux distribution:

* Amazon Linux / SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES): *ec2-user*
* CentOS: *centos*
* Ubuntu: *ubuntu*

The Linux distribution is specified in the *Bastion AMI operating system* parameter when you deploy the templates.

=== Enable and customize the Linux bastion host banner
:xrefstyle: short
This Quick Start provides a banner for the Linux bastion hosts, as illustrated in <<banner>>. The banner is disabled by default. We recommend that you enable it to notify users that all their actions will be monitored and recorded. Customize it if you like.

* To enable the banner, set the *Bastion banner* parameter to *true* during deployment.
//TODO Troy, Since the above instruction is part of the postdeployment steps, it doesn't work to say "during deployment" here. Please rephrase to indicate how we'd enable the banner after deployment. (Is it as simple as deleting "during deployment"?)
* To customize the banner, create an ASCII text file with your own banner content. Then upload the file to an S3 bucket or other publicly accessible location, and verify that it is accessible from the host.

== Additional information
=== Bastion logging
The bastion hosts deployed by this Quick Start provide a command logger in the
`/var/log/audit/audit.log` file.
This log file contains the date, SSH client connection IP address, user name, working directory, and the commands issued.

For added security, the contents of the `/var/log/audit/audit.log` file is also stored in a CloudWatch Logs log group in the AWS Cloud, and remains available in case the bastion hosts fail.

The log includes a history of the commands that are run when you log in. <<logging>> shows an example.

The `bastion.log` file is an immutable file that cannot be easily deleted or tampered with.
However, in case this happens, there is a shadow file with a copy of `bastion.log` located in `/var/log/audit/audit.log`.
The Quick Start also stores the contents of `bastion.log` remotely using the CloudWatch Logs service.
Log files can be found under CloudWatch Logs using the instance ID as the log stream name.

=== Remote access

This Quick Start provisions one Linux bastion host in each Availability Zone with a single security group as a virtual firewall.
This security group is required for remote access from the Internet if a remote access CIDR block was configured for the deployment.
The security group is configured as follows:

==== Inbound

|===
|Source|Protocol|Ports

|Remote access CIDR|TCP|22
|Remote access CIDR|ICMP|N/A
|===

==== Outbound

|===
|Destination|Protocol|Ports

|0.0.0.0/0 |All|All
|===

//TODO Troy, These last two subsections ("Bastion logging" and "Remote access") contain no actionable information, so they don't belong in "Postdeployment steps." For now, I've put them in a new section called "Additional information." It's not clear, though, what this info has to do with deploying the Quick Start. Why is it in the deployment guide at all? And do we need all this detail? Consider deleting this info here and, if needed, move it to an operational guide or elsewhere.
