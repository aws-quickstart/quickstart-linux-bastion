// Add any unique troubleshooting steps here.

For troubleshooting common Quick Start issues, refer to the https://fwd.aws/rA69w?[AWS Quick Start General Information Guide^] and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting CloudFormation^].

*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *Disabled*. This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console on the *Configure stack options* page. With this setting, the stack's state is retained, and you can troubleshoot the issue.

WARNING: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Ensure that you delete stack after troubleshooting.

For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation^].

*Q.* I encountered a size-limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* Launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template-size limitations. For more information, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS CloudFormation quotas^].

*Q.* I changed the instance type parameter after deployment and updated the stack, but the instance types did not change or the Elastic IP addresses were not reassociated after the stack update.

*A.* Terminate your bastion host instances. They will be replaced by Auto Scaling. A bootstrap action is performed on the new instances to configure security settings and CloudWatch logs and associate Elastic IP addresses.
