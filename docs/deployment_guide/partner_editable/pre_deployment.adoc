== (Optional) Create a key pair

If you want to access your Linux bastion host using SSH as well as AWS Systems Manager, you must create a key pair. For details, refer to http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[Amazon EC2 key pairs and Linux instances^] and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/create-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair[Create a key pair using Amazon EC2^].

=== (Optional) Customize the Linux bastion host banner

This Quick Start provides a banner for the Linux bastion hosts, as illustrated in <<banner>>.

To customize the banner, create an ASCII text file with your own banner content. Then upload the file to an S3 bucket or other publicly accessible location, and verify that it is accessible from the host.

To enable the banner, you set the *Bastion banner* parameter to *true* during deployment. The banner is disabled by default. We recommend that you enable it during deployment to notify users that all their actions will be monitored and recorded.
