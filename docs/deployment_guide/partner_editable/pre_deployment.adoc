NOTE: Consider choosing a Region closest to your data center or corporate network to reduce network latency between systems running on AWS and the systems and users on your corporate network.

=== (Optional) Create a key pair

If you want to access for your Linux bastion host via SSH as well as AWS Systems Manager, you must create a key pair.
To create a http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[key pair] in your preferred Region, do the following:

[start=1]
. In your AWS Management Console, choose an AWS Region.
. On the *Services* menu, choose *EC2*.
. Under *Network and Security*, choose *Key Pairs*.
. Choose *Create Key Pair*.
. Enter a name and choose *Create*.

Amazon EC2 uses public-key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt login information.
To be able to log in to your instances, you must create a key pair.
On Linux, the key pair is used to authenticate SSH login.
