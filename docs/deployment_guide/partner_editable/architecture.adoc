Deploying this Quick Start with default parameters builds the following {partner-product-short-name} environment in the AWS Cloud.

NOTE: The bastion host https://github.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-linux-bastion/pull/142[no longer has a public IP address assigned for remote access by default^]. You can https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/session-manager.html[connect to your Linux instance using Session Manager^], a capability of AWS Systems Manager. If a remote-access CIDR block is configured for the deployment, an Elastic IP address is assigned, and inbound SSH (Secure Shell) access is permitted.

.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/linux-bastion-architecture.png[Architecture, 85%]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** 1&#8209;4 Linux bastion hosts in an Auto Scaling group for connecting to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in public and private subnets.**
* An Amazon CloudWatch log group to hold the Linux bastion host shell history logs.
* AWS Systems Manager for access to the bastion host.
