.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* An internet gateway to allow access to the internet.
  This gateway is used by the bastion hosts to send and receive traffic.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group for connecting to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in public and private subnets.
*** As of https://github.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-linux-bastion/pull/142[July 25th, 2022], the Linux bastion host will not have a public IP address assigned for remote access and should be accessed via AWS Systems Manager or alternate means.
*** If a remote access CIDR block is configured for the deployment, an Elastic IP address is assigned and inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access is permitted.
* An Amazon CloudWatch log group to hold the Linux bastion host shell history logs.
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Ensure that the additional components are shown in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.

[.small]#* The template that deploys this Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
